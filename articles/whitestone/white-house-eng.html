                        the third largest Croatian island of Brač is so popular with tourists thanks to its gorgeous pebbly beach Zlatni rat (Golden Horn). And this is certainly not completely false,
                        given the scarcity of real beaches on the Adriatic coast.</font> <font size="5">However, once there, visitors discover another hidden treasure of ths piece of sunny land: the
                        white limestone.</font><br clear="all">

                        <font size="4">You may not know this, but the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington D.C., was partly built of this stone as pure as you can imagine it. It is likely
                        that the residence of US presidents erected at the end of the 18th century, today containing 35 bathrooms, 28 fireplaces, a fallout shelter as well as other conveniences of
                        the modern age, actually owes its poetic name to several impressive quarries in the middle of an incredibly turquoise sea than belonging to the Austrian Empire.</font>
                </p>
                <p>
                        <font size="4">Another version claims that the famous residence in Northern America was initially called the "President's House". It was only Theodore Roosevelt who officially
                        named it the "White House" a hundred years later, in 1901. In the meantime, during an unfortunate historical period of armed confrontations, there was an unsuccessful attempt
                        to level the whole capital of the States by fire including the presidential residence. By a mysterious coincidence, the soldiers finally abandoned their efforts and the
                        building did not completely burn down. It was only turned black from the smoke and fire damage. So, after the war the president's house was painted white, and people started
                        calling it the “White House”.</font>

                        <font size="4">In fact, Washington is not the only city that got the idea to build a public building of white limestone from the island of Brač. Parliaments in both Vienna and
                        Budapest - capitals of Austrian and Hungarian parts of the Habsburg Monarchy - also opted for the same building material. Magnificent snow white palaces in Venice, Italy,
                        resist the sea until today. Roman Emperor Diocletian was admiring the white stone of Brač already 1700 years ago and thereafter ordered a construction of his palace and
                        military fortress on the Dalmatian coast. That is how today's second-largest Croatian city of Split was founded.</font>

                <p>
                        <font size="4">A unique stonemason high school was eventually opened on the island at the beginning of the last century. Traditionally, the stone blocks have been extracted by
                        saw instead of using dynamite since the limestone is easily workable. It is therefore suitable for the finest stonework. Even today, the students use manually powered tools
                        like they would have centuries ago. The school educates each year a full class of highly skilled artisans ready to perform the arduous stone craftsmanship or continue their
                        studies in architecture and other creative fields.</font>
